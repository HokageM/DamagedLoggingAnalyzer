What is the dataset about?

- The dataset contains statistics on forest wood harvesting due to various damages in Germany,
  listed by year, type of wood species groups, and ownership types of forests.

- Each entry specifies the volume of wood harvested (in cubic meters) due to different causes
  such as wind/storm, snow/ice damage, insects, drought, and other reasons.

Why is this dataset interesting?:
Here are some interesting aspects and potential questions, which could explore using this data:

- Temporal Trends:
  How has the damage-caused wood harvesting changed over the years?
  Are there increasing trends in certain types of damage like drought or insects, possibly linked to climate change?
  How will the year 2024 look like in terms of the volume of wood harvested due to different causes?

- Damage Types:
  Which type of damage causes the most wood harvesting?
  How do different regions or types of forests compare in their vulnerability to specific damage types?

- Forest Management:
  Are there noticeable differences in wood harvesting due to damage across different forest ownership types
  (e.g., state-owned vs. privately-owned forests)? This could reflect different management practices and their effectiveness.


Potential Questions (will not be answered in this project):

- Impact of Extreme Weather:
  Are there particular years with exceptionally high damage that could be correlated to extreme weather events or climate anomalies?

- Economic and Ecological Impact:
  What might be the economic impact of these losses?
  How might these harvesting activities due to damages impact the ecological balance and biodiversity in these forests?
