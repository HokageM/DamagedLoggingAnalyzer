A project about of analyzing a statistic of damaged logging (wood) in Germany using Python.

This my individual project for the module **Research Software Engineering** in SS24.

# Damaged Logging

## What is the dataset about?

The dataset contains statistics on forest wood harvesting due to various damages in Germany,
listed by year, type of wood species groups, and ownership types of forests. 

Each entry specifies the volume of wood harvested (in cubic meters) due to different causes
such as wind/storm, snow/ice damage, insects, drought, and other reasons.

## Why is this dataset interesting?

Here are some interesting aspects and potential questions, which could explore using this data:

**Temporal Trends**: 
How has the damage-caused wood harvesting changed over the years? 
Are there increasing trends in certain types of damage like drought or insects, possibly linked to climate change?
How will the year 2024 look like in terms of the volume of wood harvested due to different causes?

**Damage Types**: 
Which type of damage causes the most wood harvesting? 
How do different regions or types of forests compare in their vulnerability to specific damage types?

**Forest Management**: 
Are there noticeable differences in wood harvesting due to damage across different forest ownership types 
(e.g., state-owned vs. privately-owned forests)? This could reflect different management practices and their effectiveness.

### Potential Questions (will not be answered in this project):

**Impact of Extreme Weather**: 
Are there particular years with exceptionally high damage that could be correlated to extreme weather events or climate anomalies?

**Economic and Ecological Impact**: 
What might be the economic impact of these losses? 
How might these harvesting activities due to damages impact the ecological balance and biodiversity in these forests?

## Temporal Trends
**Question**:
How has the damage-caused wood harvesting changed over the years? 

I created individual plots for the total volume of wood harvested due to different reasons (drought, wind/storm, snow, insects, miscellaneous, total) over the years for different types of wood species.
And additionally, I created combined plots for the different types of wood species.
**Note:** In the following, I will only show the combined plots for the different types of wood species. The other plots can be found in the [plots](https://github.com/HokageM/DamagedLoggingAnalyzer/tree/main/plots) directory or can be generated with the following command:

```bash
damaged_logg_analyzer statistic/DamagedLoggingWoodFixTable.csv --plot-temporal-dependencies --out-dir path/to/output
```

**Question**:
Are there increasing trends in certain types of damage like drought or insects, possibly linked to climate change?

All in all, the death of all species due to drought, snow, and insects can be modeled as linear (near constant) functions.
Please look in [Prediction_2024](https://github.com/HokageM/DamagedLoggingAnalyzer/tree/main/plots/Prediction_2024) for the function estimations.

The deaths of all species due to wind/storm depends on the year and fluctuate between high and low values.
But one can see a very high number of deaths due to wind/storm in the year 2006 and 2018.

The deaths of all species due to "Sonsitges" (miscellaneous) can be modeled quit good with a polynomial function and are increasing over the years.

The total deaths of all species are increasing over the years.

**Question**:
How will the year 2024 look like in terms of the volume of wood harvested due to different causes?

I used polynomial regression with k-fold cross validation to predict the volume of wood harvested due to different causes in the year 2024.
**Note:** The prediction is based on the data from 2006 to 2023. All plots can be found in the [Prediction_2024](https://github.com/HokageM/DamagedLoggingAnalyzer/tree/main/plots/Prediction_2024) directory or can be generated with the following command:

```bash
damaged_logg_analyzer statistic/DamagedLoggingWoodFixTable.csv --predict --out-dir path/to/output
```

The death of all species due to "Sonsitges" (miscellaneous) can be modeled quit good with a polynomial function, e.g. for the Beech and Hardwood species group:

<img src="plots/Prediction_2024/Buche_und_sonstiges_Laubholz/Sonstiges/Insgesamt/plot.png" width="500">

**In some cases prediction does not make sense**, because the death do not follow a polynomial function and depend on other factors, e.g. death causes by insects:

<img src="plots/Prediction_2024/Buche_und_sonstiges_Laubholz/Insekten/Insgesamt/plot.png" width="500">


Deaths due to nature like wind/storm, snow, and drought can be modeled as linear functions, e.g. for the Beech and Hardwood species group:
**Note**: One need to handle the outliers in the data, e.g. the death of the year 2018 for the Beech and Hardwood species group due to wind/storm.
Those outliers come from special events like storms, which are not predictable with the current model.

## Damage Types 
**Question**:
Which type of damage causes the most wood harvesting? 

**Question**:
How do different regions or types of forests compare in their vulnerability to specific damage types?

## Forest Management
**Question**:
Are there noticeable differences in wood harvesting due to damage across different forest ownership types 
(e.g., state-owned vs. privately-owned forests)? This could reflect different management practices and their effectiveness.
